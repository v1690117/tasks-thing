# Task integration thing (to be named sometime)
**WIP**    
**Goal**: I'm trying to learn and use Spring because everybody wants you to know Spring. Spring, Spring, do you know Spring? Why? Spring is...
Spring does... Spring... So, it`s easier to learn Spring than continue arguing.  
**Problem:** sometimes you have to use different task and issue trackers and it is very annoying.   
**Solution:** collect them all in one place thanks to this project.
